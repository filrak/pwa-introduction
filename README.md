# Vue.js PWA introduction project

> A Vue.js project with very simple PWA capabilities and a looooooot of comments. It uses firebase endpoint for orders - don't break it so the others can use it ;)

P.S: I ommited some good practices for the sake of simplicity. For example order data should be stored in indexeddb which can be accessed from your app and service worker. You should also catch errors in your code - always ;>

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
